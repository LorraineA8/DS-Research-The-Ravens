   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📊 Running the Notebooks

Execute the notebooks in order to train models and generate required files:

1. **Notebook 1: Data Understanding & Cleaning**
   - Loads and explores the dataset
   - Handles missing values
   - Performs feature selection using domain knowledge, statistics, and ML
   - Saves cleaned dataset

2. **Notebook 2: Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trains 5 models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM
   - Evaluates models using multiple metrics
   - Selects best model based on ROC AUC
   - Saves best model using joblib

3. **Notebook 3: Explainable AI (SHAP)**
   - Creates SHAP explainer
   - Analyzes feature importance
   - Generates explanations for predictions
   - Saves explainer for Streamlit use

4. **Notebook 4: Streamlit Integration Test**
   - Tests model loading
   - Verifies predictions work
   - Checks all required files exist

## 🌐 Running the Streamlit Application

1. **Ensure all notebooks have been run** (to generate model files)

2. **Navigate to the streamlit_app directory**
   ```bash
   cd streamlit_app
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🔬 Feature Selection Methodology

Our feature selection uses three complementary approaches:

### 1. Domain Knowledge
Prioritizes features that are:
- Easy to measure in village settings (no advanced equipment)
- Reliable and consistent
- Clinically relevant for Type 2 Diabetes

**Selected Features:**
- Age (very easy - self-reported)
- BMI (easy - scale and measuring tape)
- Blood Pressure (easy - standard BP cuff)
- Glucose (moderate - portable glucose meter)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function (easy - family history questionnaire)

### 2. Statistical Methods
- Correlation analysis with target variable
- Chi-square tests for categorical relationships
- Features with significant statistical association

### 3. Machine Learning
- Random Forest feature importance
- Features with high predictive power
- Cross-validation performance

## 🤖 Models Trained

The system trains and compares 5 different models:

1. **Logistic Regression** - Linear model, interpretable
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble of decision trees
3. **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting, high performance
4. **LightGBM** - Fast gradient boosting
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Kernel-based classifier

The best model (based on ROC AUC) is selected and saved for deployment.

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Precision**: Of predicted positives, how many are actually positive
- **Recall**: Of actual positives, how many did we catch
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC AUC**: Area under ROC curve (ability to distinguish classes)

## 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)

The system uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide:
- **Global Feature Importance**: Which features matter most overall
- **Individual Explanations**: Why a specific prediction was made
- **Feature Contributions**: How each feature affects the prediction
- **Natural Language Explanations**: Easy-to-understand summaries

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For Healthcare Workers:
- This tool is for **screening and educational purposes only**
- It is **not a substitute** for professional medical advice
- Always consult qualified healthcare providers for medical decisions
- Use clinical judgment alongside model predictions

### For Developers:
- Ensure all notebooks are run before deploying Streamlit app
- Model files must be in the `models/` directory
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Test predictions before using in production

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Model files not found
- **Solution**: Run all notebooks in order (1, 2, 3, 4)

### Import errors
- **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### SHAP explainer errors
- **Solution**: Run Notebook 3 to generate the SHAP explainer

### Streamlit not starting
- **Solution**: Check that you're in the `streamlit_app` directory and run `streamlit run app.py`
